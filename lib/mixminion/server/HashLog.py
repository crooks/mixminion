       already processed.

       Each HashLog corresponds to a single public key (whose hash is the
       log's keyid).  A HashLog must persist for as long as the key does.

       It is not necessary to sync the HashLog to the disk every time
       a new message is seen; instead, we must only ensure that every
       _retransmitted_ message is first inserted into the hashlog and
       synced.  (One way to implement this is to process messages from
       'state A' into 'state B', marking them in the hashlog as we go,
       and syncing the hashlog before any message is sent from 'B' to
       the network.  On a restart, we reinsert all messages waiting in 'B'
       into the log.)

       HashLogs are implemented using Python's anydbm interface.  This defaults
       to using Berkeley DB, GDBM, or --if you have none of these-- a flat
       text file."""
