       TLS connections.  This is still not a completely generic TLS
       class--it's designed to be simple enough to implement MMTP properly,
       and nothing more.

       Conceptually, a TLSConnection wraps a _minionlib.TLS object, and
       transitions between a number of logical states.  These states
       are: 'handshaking', 'exchanging data', 'shutting down',
       and 'closed.'  State transitions are either expliticly initiated
       by invocation of the class's control functions, or caused by the
       class itself based on errors or network events.

    ## Fields:
    # sock -- the underlying socket.socket object.
    # tls -- an instance of mixminion._minionlib.TLSConnection, wrapping
    #   self.sock.
    # address -- the name of the host on the other side; used in log
    #   messages.
    # wantRead, wantWrite -- flags: is this connection interested in read/write
    #   events on self.sock?  (As a special case, if wantWrite is 2, we're
    #   currently waiting for socket.connect.)
    # lastActivity -- When did this connection last get any activity?
    #
    # inbuf -- a list of strings received from self.tls
    # inbuflen -- the total length of the strings in self.inbuf
    # outbuf -- a list of strings to write to self.tls
    # outbuflen -- the total length of the strings in self.outbuf

    # __setup -- have we finished the TLS handshake.
    # __stateFn -- a function that should be invoked when this connection
    #   receives a read/write event.  One of __connectFn, __acceptFn,
    #   __dataFn, __shutdownFn.
    # __reading -- flag: are we trying to read bytes from self.tls?
    # __awaitingShutdown -- flag: have we already called shutdown once?
    # __bytesReadOnShutdown -- the number of bytes we've received since
    #   the first time we called shutdown.
    # __readBlockedOnWrite, __writeBlockedOnRead -- flags: has a read/write
    #   operation blocked on the opposite event type?
    # __blockedWriteLen -- if the last call to 'write' blocked, how much
    #   did we try to write?  (OpenSSL requires that we retry using exactly
