"""mixminion.MMTPClient

   This module contains a single, synchronous implementation of the client
   side of the Mixminion Transfer protocol.  You can use this client to
   upload packets to any conforming Mixminion server.

   (We don't use this module for transferring packets between servers;
   in fact, MMTPServer makes it redundant.  We only keep this module
   around [A] so that clients have an easy (blocking) interface to
   introduce packets into the system, and [B] so that we've got an
   easy-to-verify reference implementation of the protocol.)
